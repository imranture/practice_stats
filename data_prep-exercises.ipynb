    "Suppose it is November 2009 and you wish to sell your copy of MarioKart for the Nintendo Wii on eBay. You are curious how much people is willing to pay for this particular game and therefore you scrape all the eBay auctions from the previous month.\n",

    "### Data Overview - Mario Kart auctions from eBay\n",
    "\n",
    "The data, collected in October 2009, has the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`id`**: Numeric, Auction ID assigned by eBay.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`duration`**: Numeric, Auction length, in days.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`n_bids`**: Numeric, Number of bids.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`cond`**: Binary, Game condition, either new or used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`start_pr`**: Numeric, Start price of the auction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`ship_pr`**: Numeric, Shipping price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`total_pr`**: Numeric, Total price, which equals the auction price plus the shipping price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`ship_sp`**: Categorical, Shipping speed or method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`seller_rate`**: Numeric, The seller's rating on eBay. This is the number of positive ratings minus the number of negative ratings for the seller.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`stock_photo`**: Binary, Whether the auction feature photo was a stock photo or not. If the picture was used in many auctions, then it was called a stock photo.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`wheels`**: Numeric, Number of Wii wheels included in the auction. These are steering wheel attachments to make it seem as though you are actually driving in the game. When used with the controller, turning the wheel actually causes the character on screen to turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`title`**: String, The title of the auctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modified dataset is available as a CSV file named `mariokart.csv` and can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imranture/practice_stats/main/datasets/mariokart.csv). "
